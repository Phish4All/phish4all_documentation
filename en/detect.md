# How to Spot Fraud
Fraud attempts come in many forms, but most share common tactics designed to confuse, pressure, or mislead you.

## 1. Signs of Fraud in Any Format (Phone, SMS, Email)

### Urgency and Pressure

Scammers try to get you to act before thinking:
- “Your account will close in 30 minutes!”
- “Immediate action required!”

Legitimate organizations rarely use threats or deadlines.

### Unexpected Contact

If you didn’t expect the call, message, or email—treat it with caution, no matter how official it looks.

### Requests for Sensitive Information

Fraudsters may ask for:
- Passwords
- One-time verification codes
- Payment details
- Remote access to your phone/computer

This is always a red flag.

### Too-Good-to-Be-True Offers

Examples:

- Surprise refunds
- Prize winnings
- Job offers with unrealistic pay

## 2. How to Spot Fraud by Phone
### Key Warning Signs
- Caller claims to be from a bank, government, or delivery service.
- Caller ID looks official but feels suspicious (numbers can be spoofed).
- They ask you to stay on the line or prevent you from calling back.
- They ask for personal info or payment methods like gift cards or crypto.

### How to Confirm
- Hang up immediately.
- Call back using the official number from the organization’s website.

## 3. How to Spot Fraud by SMS
### Warning Signs
- Unexpected tracking links or “package held” messages.
- Bank or account alerts asking you to click a link.
- Shortened URLs (e.g., bit.ly).
- Messages from numbers you don’t recognize.

### How to Confirm
- Check your official app (bank, delivery service).
-Do not click any links.
- Do not reply—not even “STOP.”

## 4. How to Spot Fraud by Email (Phishing)
### Warning Signs
- Sender address looks almost right but not exact.
- Unexpected password reset or payment request.
- Attachments you didn’t expect.

### How to Confirm
- Hover over links to preview the real URL.
- Access your account through the official website or app, not by clicking the email.

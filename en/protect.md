# How to Protect Yourself
Protecting yourself from fraud begins with building strong habits. These practices reduce your chances of becoming a victim—no matter whether scammers contact you by phone, SMS, or email.

## 1. Strengthen Your Digital Security
### Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Activate MFA on:
- Banking apps
- Email accounts
- Social media
- Online shopping accounts

Even if someone gets your password, they cannot log in without your second authentication step.

### Keep Your Devices Updated

Install security updates on:
- Phones
- Computers
- Apps

Updates patch vulnerabilities scammers often exploit.

### Enable Spam and Scam Filters

Most email services and phone carriers offer:
- Spam detection
- Fraud warnings
- Call screening

Activate these features to block many scam attempts before they reach you.

## 2. Avoid Sharing Personal Information
Never share sensitive details through phone, SMS, or email:
- Passwords
- PIN codes
- Verification codes
- Full credit card numbers
- Photos of ID or bank cards

Legitimate companies will never ask for this information unexpectedly.

## 3. Verify Messages Through Official Channels
If a company contacts you:
- Do not click links inside the message.
- Instead, open the app or website manually.
- Or call the company using a verified number (from their official site).

This removes the scammer’s ability to trick you with fake links or fake phone numbers.

## 4. Protect Your Phone Number and Email
Scammers often collect numbers from:
- Online forms
- Data leaks
- Social media

Limit where you share your number or email and avoid posting them publicly.

## 5. Trust Your Instincts
If something feels weird, rushed, or too good to be true:
- Pause
- Verify
- Do not act until you’re sure

Your intuition is often the first and best line of defense.

# Pig Butchering Fraud

## 1. Overview
**Pig Butchering Fraud** is a long-term social engineering scam where criminals build trust with victims—often through social media, dating apps, or messaging platforms—and gradually convince them to invest in fake or fraudulent financial platforms (commonly crypto).  
The fraudster “fattens” the victim with emotional manipulation before “slaughtering” them by stealing all funds.

## 2. How the Scam Works
1. **Initial Contact**  
   - Random messages (“wrong number”), dating apps, social media.
2. **Relationship Building**  
   - Daily conversations, emotional bonding, shared “goals.”
3. **Investment Introduction**  
   - Fake crypto trading platforms, screenshots of false profits.
4. **Escalation**  
   - Pressure to invest more, “limited-time opportunities.”
5. **Final Theft**  
   - Withdrawals blocked, demands for extra fees, disappearance.

## 3. Key Red Flags
- Fast emotional intimacy.
- Unsolicited investment advice.
- Promises of high or guaranteed returns.
- Use of unregulated investment platforms.
- Difficulty withdrawing funds.

## 4. Prevention
- Do not invest based on online relationships.
- Verify identities independently.
- Use only licensed and regulated platforms.
- Provide training on long-con scams.
- Monitor unusual crypto-related transactions.

## 5. Response Steps
- Stop communication immediately.
- Secure affected accounts.
- Attempt transaction recall if possible.
- Collect evidence (screenshots, URLs, conversations).
- Report to cybercrime authorities and internal teams.

## 6. Summary
Pig Butchering is a romance-investment scam combining emotional manipulation with fake financial platforms. Awareness, verification, and strong reporting processes are key to prevention.

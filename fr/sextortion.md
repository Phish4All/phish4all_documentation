# Sextortion Fraud

## 1. Overview
**Sextortion Fraud** is a form of extortion in which a fraudster manipulates a victim into sharing private or intimate images and then threatens to publicly release them unless demands are met.  
The scam relies heavily on psychological pressure, shame, and fear to coerce victims into paying money or providing additional explicit content.

## 2. How the Scam Works
1. **Initial Contact**  
   - Social media, dating apps, messaging platforms.
2. **Trust Building**  
   - Friendly conversation, flirting, sharing fake intimate photos.
3. **Collection of Explicit Material**  
   - Fraudster encourages the victim to send private images or videos.
4. **Threat Phase**  
   - Fraudster threatens to share the content with family, friends, or online.
5. **Extortion**  
   - Demands for payment or additional photos to prevent exposure.

## 3. Key Red Flags
- Rapid escalation toward sexual conversations.
- Requests to switch to private messaging apps.
- Pressure to exchange intimate images quickly.
- Threats, emotional manipulation, or aggressive language.
- Accounts with minimal activity or inconsistent identity details.

## 4. Prevention
- Avoid sharing intimate content with unknown or unverified individuals.
- Disable automatic contact syncing on social media.
- Be cautious of sudden romantic or sexual interest online.
- Use privacy settings and limit publicly visible information.
- Educate users on social engineering and digital blackmail techniques.

## 5. Response Steps
- Stop all communication immediately.

- Report the account on the social platform.
- Capture and save evidence (screenshots, usernames, URLs).
- Contact cybercrime authorities or internal security teams.
- Provide support to victims (psychological, legal, and digital security).

## 6. Summary
Sextortion is an extortion scheme using intimate content to coerce victims.  
Awareness, safe online behavior, and swift reporting are essential to reduce risk and protect individuals from harm.
